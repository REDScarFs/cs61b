<p>Below are some instructions for installing Git for Windows which will come with
Git Bash (a Unix-like shell for Windows bundled with some common Linux Tools) and
Git GUI (a GUI for Git on Windows). You will want to install at least one of these
tools in order to use Git this semester.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Head over to git-scm.com/download/win to download the latest version of Git
  for Windows.</li>
  <li>When the Git-*.exe file has finished downloading, execute it and continue
  through the installation. When you reach 'Select Components', make sure 'Windows
  Explorer integration' is checked.
  Note: It is recommended to select 'Advanced context menu', which will include both
  Git Bash and Git GUI (this option allows you to make use of additional Git features
  when you right-click files). If you do not wish for this, choose 'Simple context
  menu'.</li>
  <li>Complete the rest of the installation (none of the remaining settings need to
  be changed).</li>
  <li>Now, to check that the installation has succeeded, you will be able to find
  Git Bash / GUI in your Start menu (Start -&gt; All Programs -&gt; Git -&gt; Git Bash / GUI).</li>
</ol>

<ul>
  <li>If you are running Windows 8, then you can either press Windows + s and type
  in 'Git' and you should see Git Bash / GUI or do Start -&gt; Apps and Git Bash / GUI
  will be listed under Git.</li>
</ul>

<p>Congratulations! You have successfully installed Git Bash / GUI onto your Windows
machine.</p>

<p>If you already have <a href="http://brew.sh/">Homebrew</a> installed, you should just have
to type in the following command to get command line Git:</p>

<pre><code>$ brew install git</code></pre>


<h4 id="without-homebrew">Without Homebrew</h4>


<p>Or you can directly install git <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac">here</a>.</p>


<h2 id="c-linux-ubuntu">C. Linux/Ubuntu</h2>


<p>For Linux (Ubuntu / Debian) users, Git is available via apt-get. To install Git
on a non-root user, run the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ sudo apt-get install git</code></pre>

<p>After installation, type</p>

<pre><code>$ git</code></pre>

<p>and you should see a usage message!</p>
