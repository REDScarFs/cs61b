            <div class="text">
                The CS 61 series is an introduction to computer science, with particular
                emphasis on software and machines from a programmer's point of view.
                CS 61A covered high-level approaches to problem-solving, providing you with
                a variety of ways to organize solutions to programming problems as
                compositions of functions, collections of objects, or sets of rules. In
                CS 61B, we move to a somewhat more detailed (and to some extent, more basic)
                level of programming.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                In 61A, the <i>correctness</i> of a program was our primary goal. In CS61B,
                we're concerned also with <i>engineering</i>. An engineer, it is
                said, is someone who can do for a dime what any fool can do for a dollar.
                Much of 61B will be concerned with the tradeoffs in time and memory for
                a variety of methods for structuring data.  We'll also be concerned with the
                engineering knowledge and skills needed to build and maintain moderately
                large programs.

            <div class="segmenttitle">FAQ for the First Two Weeks</div>
            <div class="text">
                <b>Q: Are they labs and discussions during the first week?</b></br>
                Yes to both. The first discussion will be January 20th. 
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <b>Q: Can I attend a different section than the one I'm registered for in Telebears?</b></br>
                Ideally, you should attend the sections for which you are officially registered (if any). If you choose to attend a different section than your official section, please wait outside the room until two minutes before the section starts (XX:08). If there is still room, you are welcome to crash the section. You're welcome to do this to shop around and find your favorite GSI. You do not need to officially switch on Telebears, though we recommend that you let the GSIs in charge know that you're switching.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <b>Q: I'm on the waitlist, what should I do?</b></br>
                We will with near certainty be able to enroll everyone who meets the prerequisites. If you are wait-listed and
                do meet the prerequisites (61A, 61AS, or E7), stick around and work on everything as if you are enrolled in the class. People generally drop within the first few weeks, which will give you a chance to snipe their spot. Those of you who intend to drop: <tt>please</tt> inform Tele-BEARS
                as soon as possible. Do not contact us by email with registration issues, but feel free to post on Piazza. If you are a concurrent enrollment student, your application will probably take at least a week to resolve.

                <b>Q: Do I need to buy any books, equipment, or special outfits to wear for the course?</b></br>
                The textbook for the first six weeks of this course is <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=head+first+java&oq=head+first+java&aqs=chrome..69i57j69i59.870j0j1&sourceid=chrome&es_sm=91&ie=UTF-8"><i>Head First Java, 2nd Edition</i> by Sierra
                and Bates (O'Reilly, 2005).</a> This book is highly recommended (but not absolutely required) for those of you without Java experience. It's a great book, and really cheap for a textbook. Please don't Pirate Bay the book. This is not nice. You'll want this ASAP.

                Similar to Dan Garcia's EPA system, we will bump students at grading boundaries based on Effort, Participation, and Altruism. One way to Participate is answering in-class questions in class. Questions can be answered using an iClicker device, a mobile app, or a laptop. iClickers are not required for the course.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                <b>Q: Is attendance required?</b></br>
                Lecture attendance is not required. One of the two lectures will be webcast. Time permitting, I may also provide supplementary videos. EPA points can be acquired by commenting on our videos using the lect.io platform (details coming soon). This will count as an alternative to clicker-type questions for those of you who like watching lecture on your own time. Discussion section attendance is not required. Lab attendance is required unless you submit the lab early. See below for more details.

            <h2 class="segmenttitle">Background Knowledge</h2>
            <div class="text">
                This class assumes you have taken CS61A, CS61AS, or E7, or have equivalent background to a student who has taken one of these courses. The course is largely built upon the assumption that you have taken CS61A or CS61AS, and E7 students may find the beginning of the course to be a bit scarier, particularly when it comes to object oriented programming and linked list manipulation.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                We assume you are coming in with zero Java experience. Nonetheless, we will move through basic Java syntax very quickly. Though the syntaxes of Java, Python, MATLAB, Scheme, etc. are enormously different, the underlying computational models are surprisingly similar.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                If you already have Java experience, great! We hope that you'll help out your fellow students in discussion, lab, and on Piazza, particularly in the opening weeks when everyone is catching up on Java.

                It would be nice, though not absolutely necessary, to have some UNIX experience before the semester starts.
                All the instructional machines for this course will be running various flavors of the
                UNIX operating system (generally, Ubuntu) and it's a really good idea for you to become familiar
                with it. There will be online resources for learning Unix linked from the 1st lab. We will also announce on-campus help sessions on the announcements section of this website. If you'd like a physical reference, Paul Hilfinger suggests <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/offer-listing/0805375651/ref=dp_olp_used?ie=UTF8&amp;condition=used">"A Practical Guide to The Unix System (3rd edition)" by Mark Sobell

            <h2 class="segmenttitle">Is this the right course for me?</h2>
            <div class="text">
                This is a course about data structures and programming methods. It happens to also teach Java,
                since it is hard to teach programming without a language. However, it is not intended
                as an exhaustive course on Java, the World-Wide Web, creating applets, user interfaces,
                graphics, or any of that fun stuff.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Some of you may have already had a data structures course, and simply want to learn
                Java or C++. For you, self-study may be a better option. CS 9F (C++ for programmers) and
                CS 9G (Java for programmers) are both one-unit self-paced courses that will teach you more
                of what you want to know in less time. There is no enrollment limit for that course, and
                you work through it at your own pace after the first and only lecture.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Finally, the 1-unit self-paced course CS 47B is for students "with sufficient partial credit
                in 61B," allowing them (with instructor's permission) to complete the 61B course requirement
                without taking the full course.

            <h2 class="segmenttitle">Discussion and Lab Sections</h2>
            <div class="text">
                Each week there is a 1 hour discussion section and a 2 hour lab section headed by a GSI, and supported by volunteer lab assistants. Information about the staff running each section can be found on the <a href="staff.html">staff page</a>.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                If you decide to permanently switch sections, it'd be best to switch in Telebears. However, if the section is officially full or doing so would somehow cause you significant grief, it's OK to simply clear it with the two TAs involved.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Attendance is optional for discussion, but may be taken into account if you're on a grading boundary. Lab attendance is mandatory and missing a lab will result in a 10% penalty to that week's lab, though if you submit the lab early (by 10:00 PM on Wednesday), you may skip lab that week. You may skip any number of labs via early submission. During weeks in which labs are not graded, attendance is not required.
            </div>   
            <div class="text">
                Labs will be online, so you will be able to do much of the work ahead of time. Nonetheless, we encourage you to attend your scheduled lab time. 
                One major purpose of the labs is to give your TA a chance to check up on you and to find
                out what people are and are not understanding. We've found that with the increasing
                ability to work anywhere has come an increasing tendency for students to go off by themselves
                and fall behind.  Don't make this mistake. Keep up with homework and lab work and above

                For most questions about the course, Piazza is the right place to ask them. The course staff
                read it regularly, so you will get a quick answer. Furthermore, by posting online
                as opposed to emailing us directly, other students benefit by seeing the question and
                the answer. Don't forget to check Piazza before asking your question, just in case

                correspondence that you don't want to send to Piazza. We all read it, so you will usually
                get a quick reply. If you send a question that is of general interest, we may post the

                To talk with us, the best way is to come during regular office hours (posted on the home page).
                Many of us are available at other times by appointment.  Please don't be shy. Web pages, email,
                and Piazza are useful, but it's still much easier to understand something when you can

                Version-control systems allow you maintain a series of "snapshots" of your files at
                various points in their development. Used properly, this provides you some back-up
                protection, so that you can recover previous states of your work when something goes wrong.

When you submit your homework to the ag branch, you will receive an email with feedback from the 'release' test. When you are satisfied with your performance, submit your code to the submit branch. To hopefully save you from painful debugging session, your homework only needs to pass 80% of the autograder tests for full credit, except for HW7 which requires only 50%.
            <!--There will also be a set of 'secret' tests that will be run two days after the homework is officially due. You will have until the end of the semester to correctly pass the secret tests. Half of each homework will be based on passing the 'release' test, and half on the 'secret' tests. <i>Note: This policy is under revision and is going to be made somewhat friendlier.

             <div class="text">Edit 4/10/15: After the due date, hw may be submitted to the submit branch. Unlike hw submitted before the due date, your score will be the exact autograder score (i.e. no 80% rule) as judged by the more rigorous secret grader, with the exception of hw1/hw2/hw3 which require only 50% passage on secret tests for full credit.

                We grade projects and homework <i>on the instructional machines.</i> Very often, you
                will find that for various reasons (different software versions, different
                operating systems), a Java program will work on your home machine, but not on ours.

            Lab grading schemas vary. Most labs will be on correctness, but there will be no secret tests. Some of the labs are freebies (during project weeks). <b>Edit 4/10/15:</b> Like HW, labs can be submitted after the deadline for full credit. Unlike HW, there are no secret tests.

                Homeworks will be due at 10 PM on their respective due dates. Labs are due by 10:00 PM each Sunday after they are assigned. There is a short (unspecified) grace period for homeworks. There are no slip hours or slip days for homeworks. Your two lowest homeworks/labs will be dropped (for a total of two drops, not four). <b>Edit 4/10/15:</b> Any HW or lab can be resubmitted by May 4th at 11:59 PM.

            <li>A HW submitted after its deadline requires 100% correctness on the secret tests for full credit, except HW1/HW2/HW3 which require 50%.

            <div class="text">
                There will be 4 larger programming projects. Projects are individual efforts, with the same collaboration rules as HW. You'll have later classes in which to build your teamwork skills. For 61B, our goal is to help you build the independence and fundamental skills that you'll need to thrive when building large programs.
            </div>
            <div class="text">            
                Project 0 and 1 will be relatively easier than projects 2 and 3, taking less time and with greater levels of scaffolding. Project 2 will be a very difficult project (on par with what you might expect from Hilfinger's harder projects). Project 3 will be challenging, but not as time consuming as project 2.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                Each project will have three graders: 'basics', 'release', and 'secret'. The basics autograder will be running as soon as the assignment is out, and will provide verbose output. Successful completion of the basics autograder before the basics deadline will yield a point of extra credit.
            </div>
            <div class="text">
                The release autograder will run once per day in the days leading up to an assignment. Typically, the release tests will provide less feedback. Release tests will switch from running once per day to running continuously after the assignment deadline. The results of the secret autograder tests will not be given out, and are only used for grading purposes. As the semester progresses, the number of tests that are given as 'basic' and 'release' tests will decrease.

                Projects 0, 1, 2, and 3 will be worth 10, 18, 24, and 18 points respectively. Projects 2 and 3 will each have 5 points worth of gold points. These will be especially challenging parts of the assignment. If you opt not to do the gold point parts of the projects, we will reweight your exams by 14/13ths.  <b>Edit (5/27/2015):</b> To incentivize people who want to do only one project's gold points, we'll give you Math.max(gold2 + gold3 + exams, max(gold2, gold3) + 27/26 * exams, 14/13 * exams).

You will be allowed to bring one page of handwritten notes (front and back) to midterm 1, two pages to midterm 2, and three pages to the final. Pages must be of reasonable physical dimensions.

                Sufficient cause includes conflicting exams for other courses, medical or family

                a note explaining your complaint. You should check the online solutions first to
                make sure that this regrade will make your total score go up as it is possible to lose

                <!-- Midterm grades can be "shadowed". This is the only place in the course where something like curving occurs. It works thus: Suppose you are SM standard deviations above the mean on a midterm and SF standard deviations above the mean on the final. If (SF - 0.5 > SM), then your midterm score will be completely replaced so that you are SF - 0.5 standard deviations above the original (pre-shadowed) midterm mean. For example, suppose you are 1.6 stdevs above the mean on the final and 1.2 stdev BELOW the mean on the midterm, then SF = 1.6 and SM = -1.2. Since SF - 0.5 > -1.2, your midterm score will be adjusted so you are now 1.1 stdevs above the mean. -->
                Midterm (both MT1 and MT2) grades can be "shadowed" (aka a weaker version of "clobbered") by the final. The way it works is that if you are X standard deviations from the mean, your midterm scores will be replaced by a score equivalent to X - 0.5 standard deviations from the mean. This policy can only help, and cannot hurt your score.

                <p>Effectively, this only applies if you improve substantially on your final: an improvement of over 0.5 standard deviations. 

                </p><p>For example, suppose Bilbo scored 0.4 standard deviations above the mean on MT1, 0.9 standard deviations above the mean on MT2, and 1.1 standard deviations above the mean on the final. Then Bilbo's midterm scores will be replaced by 1.1 - 0.5 = 0.6 standard deviations above the mean, as long as this is an improvement.

                </p><p>Since Bilbo already got 0.4 above the mean on MT1, his score would be replaced by 0.6. However, his score on MT2 would not be changed (since he is already 0.9 above the mean).

                </p><p>As another example, suppose Bilbo is -1.1 above the mean on MT1, -0.1 on MT2, and 0.3 on the final, his midterm scores would be replaced by -0.2 (0.3 - 0.5) if that helps. In Bilbo's case, his MT1 score would be replaced by -0.2, and MT2 score would be untouched (since it is already better).

               
                <!-- his MT1 score would be replaced with the equivalent of 0.6 standard deviations (1.1 - 0.4 = 0.6) above (pre-shadowed) the original mean. Bilbo's MT2 score remains untouched (1.1 - 0.9 = 0.2, which is not greater than 0.5). In conclusion, you can shadow a bad midterm if you show substantial improvement, but that shadowing can only help you to a certain degree.-->

                <div class="text">Deadlines can be stressful, and we know that under extreme pressure, it becomes tempting to start rationalizing actions that you would otherwise yourself consider inappropriate. Perhaps you'll find yourself facing a 61B project deadline, and under all this stress you'll convince yourself that you're just going to cheat for the moment so you can get the points, and that you'll come back later and really learn the thing you were supposed to have learned in order to restore your karmic balance (I've heard something along these lines a few times).

                </div><div class="text">This is a terrible idea. Obviously it's important to learn how to deal with deadlines, but far more important than that, giving into this sort of pressure under not-so-dire circumstances is going to do some damage to your moral compass. Someday, when the consequences are higher than potentially losing a 1/3rd of a letter grade, you may find yourself committing dishonest acts at the cost of someone else's livelihood or life.

                </div><div class="text">In CS61B, we have three types of assignments: homeworks, labs, and projects. The entire point of homeworks and labs is to learn. You should feel free to collaborate with others, though keep in mind that greater independence is likely to give you a better learning experience (as long as you aren't totally stuck).

                </div><div class="text">By contrast, the projects were designed for learning (particularly how to be self-reliant in the context of large unfamiliar systems), as well as for the dual purpose of evaluating of your mastery of the course material. As such, they are intended to be completed primarily on your own, particularly when it comes to writing the actual code. 

                </div><div class="text">Cheating on a project will earn you a negative score for that project, i.e. if a project is worth 127 points of your course grade, you will instead lose 127 points from your final point total. Cheating a second time or on an exam will earn you an F in the course. All incidents of cheating will be referred to the Office of Student Conduct.

                </div><div class="text">What constitutes cheating? The golden rule of academic dishonesty is that you should not claim to be responsible for work that is not yours. 

                </div><div class="text">This is obviously open to some interpretation, and you'll be getting some help from instructors, the internet, other students, and more throughout the course. This is OK, and we hope that the class is an open, welcoming, collaborative environment where we can help each other build the highest possible understanding of the course material.

                </div><div class="text">To help (but not entirely define) the bounds of acceptable behavior, we have three important rules for projects:

                </div><div class="text">1. <b>By You Alone</b>: All project code that you submit (other than skeleton code) should be written by you alone, except for small snippets that solve tiny subproblems (examples in the Permitted section below). 

                </div><div class="text">2. <b>Do Not Possess or Share Code</b>: Before a project deadline, you should never be in possession of solution code that you did not write. You will be equally culpable if you distribute such code to other students or future students of 61B (within reason). DO NOT GIVE ANYONE YOUR CODE -- EVEN IF THEY ARE DESPERATELY ASKING. DO NOT POST SOLUTIONS TO PROJECTS ONLINE (on GitHub or anywhere else)! If you're not sure what you're doing is OK, please ask.

                </div><div class="text">3. <b>Cite Your Sources</b>: When you receive significant assistance on a project from someone else, you should cite that assistance somewhere in your source code. We leave it to you to decide what constitutes 'significant'.

                </div><div class="text">For clarity, examples of specific activities are listed below:

                </div><div class="text">Permitted:<ul>
                <li>Discussion of approaches for solving a problem. 
                </li><li>Giving away or receiving significant conceptual ideas towards a problem solution. Such help should be cited as comments in your code. We ask that you try not to give away anything juicy, and instead try to lead people to such solutions.
                </li><li>Discussion of specific syntax issues and bugs in your code.
                </li><li>Using small snippets of code that you find online for solving tiny problems (e.g. googling "uppercase string java" may lead you to some sample code that you copy and paste into your solution). Such usages should be cited as comments in your hw, lab, and especially project code!</li></ul>

                </div><div class="text">Permitted with Extreme Caution:
                 <ul>

                <li> Looking at someone else's project code to assist with debugging. Typing or dictacting code into someone else's computer is a violation of the "By You Alone" rule. 

                </li><li> Looking at someone else's project code to understand a particular idea or part of a project. This is strongly discouraged due to the danger of plagiarism, but not absolutely forbidden. We are very serious about the "By You Alone" rule!</li></ul>

                </div><div class="text"> Absolutely Forbidden:<ul>
                <li> Possessing another student's project code in any form before a final deadline, be it electronic or on paper. This includes the situation where you're trying to help someone debug. Distributing such code is equally forbidden.
                </li><li> Possessing project solution code that you did not write yourself (from online (e.g. GitHub), staff solution code found somewhere on a server it should not have been, etc.) before a final deadline. Distributing such code is equally forbidden.</li></ul>

                </div><div class="text">We have advanced cheating detection software, and we will routinely run this code to detect cheating. Every semester, we catch and penalize a significant number of people. Do not be one of them. If you find yourself at such a point of total desperation that cheating begins to look attractive, contact one of the instructors and we can maybe help somehow. Likewise, if 61B is causing massive disruption to your personal life, please contact us directly.

                </div><div class="text">Submissions that are someone else's work, but which are appropriately cited, will be given zero points (as opposed to a negative score and a referral to the administration).

                </div><div class="text">Obviously, the expressive power of Java is a subset of the English language. And yes, you can obviously obey the letter of this entire policy while completely violating its spirit. However, this policy is not a game to be defeated, and such circumventions will be seen as plagiarism.

                </div><div class="text">The above rules apply for projects. When it comes to HW and labs, you should strive to do as much as you can alone, but it is OK to work with others (even sharing code, although we recommend that you do this very sparingly) if you feel that you'll learn better that way. Nonetheless, you should not submit other student's HW or lab code as your own, and identical or near identical submissions will be treated as plagiarism. Though we have not enumerated a specific penalty for plagiarising HW and labs in this document, we reserve the right to enact an appropriate penalty from the <a href="http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu/Policies/acad.dis.shtml">departmental policy</a> on academic dishonesty.
