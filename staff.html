                            I also made it to the top 100 players worldwide for Super Hexagon during my first
                            year at Cal. Oh, and I love to teach 61B! :)

                          Last year, I faked an accent for a MatLab game show. I once fell down a mountain and almost got speared on a fence. From my many failures in life, I have amassed a plethora of lol-zy stories. If you're interested, I would love to tell you a story. Seriously. Reach out to me, and I'll tickle your hand. I want to make sure your 61B experience is as meaningful and interesting as possible, and that all starts by letting me meet you.
