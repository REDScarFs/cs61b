Part I: Identifying Sort Algorithms
-----------------------------------
The histograms are numbered 1, 2, 3, and 4, each number corresponding to a different sorting algorithm you have seen in class. Identify each algorithm. 

How can you tell which is which? 
- First:	Quick sort;
- Second:	Selection sort;
- Third:	Merge sort;
- Fourth:	Insertion sort;

Which is fastest on the random data?
- Quick sort is the fastest.

What about the presorted data and the reverse sorted data?
- Insertion sort is the fastest in presorted array
- Merge sort is the fastest in reverse sorted data

One of the algorithms is quicksort. Which element does it choose for the pivot in a partition? (The pivot is not randomly chosen.) How can you tell?
- This quick sort always chooses the first element as its pivot because in the reverse-sorted array, the first element is the largest and nothing changes after first scanning.
