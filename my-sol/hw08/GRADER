Part IV.

  Is mergesort stable?  
  Why or why not?
  Yes. When having two equal keys, we divide and merge always from left to right. That keeps the order of the two equal keys.

  Is quicksort stable?  
  Why or why not?
  Yes. When partitioning two equal keys, they are dequeued and enqueue in order, from left to right. That maintains the order.
