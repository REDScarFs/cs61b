<h2 id="a-java-compilation-amp-development">A. Java Compilation &amp; Development</h2>


<p>Java 1.7 is currently installed on the instructional machines. You may need to
install it on your personal computer. You can do that by downloading the
Java 1.7 JDK from <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html">Oracle</a>.
Downloading the JDK should also provide <code>javac</code>, a Java compiler.</p>


<h4 id="java-is-compiled">Java Is Compiled</h4>


<p>Java is a compiled language rather than an interpreted language (like Python or
Scheme.) When code in an interpreted language runs, an interpreter program
translates the code into actions that the computer then executes. In contrast,
a compiled language must first uses a <em>compiler</em> to translate the actions. Only
afterwards can the computer run the resulting compiled code, either on the
computer directly, or in Java's case, on an interpreter called the <em>Java
virtual machine</em>.</p>

<p>Let's see an example. Here is the "Hello World" program in Java. Don't worry
about understanding it right now. We'll deconstruct it later in this lab.</p>

<pre><code>public class HelloWorld {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello world!");
    }
}</code></pre>

<p>Here is what the corresponding Java compiled code (called <em>bytecode</em>) looks
like. The virtual machine can interpret this to run the program.</p>

<p><img src="bytecode.png" alt="Java bytecode"></p>


<h4 id="why-compilation">Why Compilation?</h4>


<p>At this point, you may be wondering by Java is compiled. Compilers are quite
helpful for several reasons:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Compilers can check for errors prior to runtime. The Java compiler will
  catch and report errors like:</p>

  <ul>
    <li>type errors, which can be produced by giving functions the wrong
    objects as parameters (like a <code>String</code> instead of a <code>int</code>)</li>
    <li>syntax errors, which can be caused by forgetting syntactical elements like
    parentheses or braces</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Catching these and many other types of errors prior to runtime help catch
  many of the possible bugs caused by programmer error and make Java programs
  more stable before they are run.</p></li>
  <li>Compilers can help speed up programs. Programs written in interpreted
  languages can be slow because interpreters must parse text that is
  understandable to humans and translate it into instructions that can be
  directly understood by the machine. The compiler does this translation work
  once and saves the instructions to a file called a <em>binary</em>.  Then each time we
  run the binary, the machine reads the instructions directly, saving time and
  work.</li>
  <li>Compilers can verify access rights to classes and methods. Java has a lot
  of built-in security because access rights can be assigned to each class and
  method. Special keywords called <em>access modifiers</em> limit what other classes and
  methods have access to. The compiler checks that every program that uses a class
  or calls a method has the correct access rights to use or call it. You will
  learn more about this later in the course.</li>
</ol>

<p>There are many other reasons some languages have compilers, some of which you
will learn by taking CS 61C. But for now, you will just need to know how to
compile and run your Java program.</p>


<h4 id="compiling-java-programs">Compiling Java Programs</h4>


<p>There are many different <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_compiler">Java compilers</a>,
but we'll be using <code>javac</code> for command line in this class. As mentioned above,
<code>javac</code> is included in Oracle's Java Development Kit (JDK), so you can set it up
on your own computer if you'd like.</p>

<p>To compile a Java file called <code>File.java</code>, type the following command into your
terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ javac File.java</code></pre>

<p>You can also add some helpful options, which are called <em>flags</em> to the
compile command. A full documentation is available <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/tools/windows/javac.html">here</a>.</p>

<pre><code>$ javac -g File.java</code></pre>

<p>The "-g" flag is one of the most helpful flags because it will generate
debugging information, including local variables. This is good for testing
programs. We encourage you to use this flag when testing your code during
the development process.</p>


<h4 id="running-java-programs">Running Java Programs</h4>


<p>Compiling your program using the command above should give you <code>.class</code> files.
Opening the <code>.class</code> files will show you something like the bytecode in the
image at the very beginning of this lab.</p>

<p>Once you have your <code>File.class</code> file, you can run your Java program with this
command in your terminal:</p>

<pre><code>$ java File</code></pre>

<p>Note that you do not type <code>File.class</code>. That is a common mistake that will
cause an error message like this:</p>

<pre><code>Error: Could not find or load main class</code></pre>


<h4 id="running-hello-world">Running Hello World</h4>


<p>Create a new text file called <code>HelloWorld.java</code> and type in the <code>HelloWorld</code>
program above. Then compile and run it using the following commands:</p>

<pre><code>$ javac HelloWorld.java
$ java HelloWorld</code></pre>

<p>You should see <code>Hello world!</code> printed out in your terminal.</p>


<h4 id="java-documentation">Java Documentation</h4>


<p>The Java language has incredible <a href="http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/">API</a>
(Application Programming Interface) documentation, which is often very
helpful when using classes and methods in packages created by other
programmers. Don't worry about understanding how to use or read this
documentation yet. Just know that it is available and will come in very handy
in the future.</p>


<h4 id="a-note-on-ides">A Note on IDEs</h4>


<p>An IDE (integrated development environment) is a program that can be used to
write and run programs without using command line. They provide useful features
like debugging and are popular tools for programmers to write and test their
code. There exist many popular IDEs for Java such as</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="http://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://netbeans.org/">NetBeans</a></li>
</ul>

<p>You may use one if you would like. However, it is important to still know how
to compile and run Java programs on command line.</p>

<p><strong>IMPORTANT</strong>: Also, the course staff will not be officially supporting any of
these IDEs. You will need to figure out how to use them on your own.</p>


<h2 id="b-writing-java-programs">B. Writing Java Programs</h2>



<h4 id="java-is-object-oriented">Java is Object-Oriented</h4>


<p>Java is an <em>object-oriented</em> programming language. Those of you who took 61A/AS
may recognize that term as having been applied to Python/Scheme. Java takes OOP
a step further. In Java, all programs have class definitions.  Methods and
variables exist within classes.</p>


<h4 id="format-of-a-java-program">Format of a Java Program</h4>


<p>Every Java file contains a public class, interface, or enum. For now, let's
just discuss <em>class definitions</em>. A definition provides the name of the class
as well as its <em>variables</em> and <em>methods</em>.</p>

<p>Here is a deconstruction of the aforementioned "Hello World" program:</p>

<p><img src="HelloWorld.png" alt="HelloWorld" title="HelloWorld"></p>

<p>A Java program consists of a collection of one of more of these Java files
containing classes, interfaces, or enums. At least one of the classes in a Java
program must contain a method called <code>main</code>. This main method is called in order
to run the program.</p>

<p>This is why running the <code>HelloWorld</code> program prints out <code>Hello world!</code>. The
<code>main</code> methods in the <code>HelloWorld</code> class is being run when you type
<code>java HelloWorld</code> into the terminal.</p>


<h4 id="comments-in-java">Comments in Java</h4>


<p>There are two formats for comments in a Java program:</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>single-line comments start with two consecutive slash characters and
  continues to the end of the line</p>

<pre><code>// This is one kind of comment</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>multi-line comments start with /* and end with */</p>

<pre><code>/* This is a
   multi-line
   comment */</code></pre></li>
</ol>

<p>Some commenting styles add single asterisks at the start of each line in the
comment after the first, to improve readability.</p>

<pre><code>/* This is a
 * multi-line
 * comment */</code></pre>


<h4 id="example-leap-year-program">Example: Leap-Year Program</h4>


<p>For our first Java program, we'll be writing a program that prints out whether
or not a year is a leap year or not. A leap year is either:</p>

<ol>
  <li>divisible by 400 <strong>or</strong></li>
  <li>divisible by 4 and not by 100.</li>
</ol>

<p>For example, 2000 and 2004 are leap years. 1900, 2003, and 2100 are not leap
years.</p>

<p>Your Java file should be called <code>LeapYear.java</code>. These lines should go into the
<code>main</code> method of the <code>LeapYear</code> class. Remember that your class name should
match the name of your file. Your program should include the line:</p>

<pre><code>int year = 2000;</code></pre>

<p>If you're not sure where to start, you can copy and paste lines from <a href="lab1_copy_and_paste.txt">this file</a>.</p>


<h4 id="some-java-vocabulary-in-leap-year">Some Java Vocabulary in Leap Year</h4>


<ul>
  <li>The <code>%</code> operator implements <em>remainder</em>. Thus, the value of <code>year % 4</code>
  will be 0, 1, 2, or 3.</li>
  <li>The <code>!=</code> operator compares two values for <em>inequality</em>. The code fragment
  <code>if (year % 4 != 0)</code> reads as "if the remainder when dividing <code>year</code> by 4 is
  not equal to 0."</li>
  <li>The method <code>System.out.println</code> prints its argument to "standard output"
  (which is, in this case, your terminal window) when called.</li>
  <li>When one of the arguments of the <code>+</code> operator is a string, the arguments are
  concatenated as strings. <em>String concatenation</em> is the operation of joining
  two character strings end-to-end.</li>
</ul>


<h4 id="testing-leap-year">Testing Leap Year</h4>


<p>When you've arranged the lines properly and compiled successfully, running
the program should print out the following line:</p>

<pre><code>2000 is a leap year.</code></pre>

<p>You can test your program with other <code>year</code> values by changing the line</p>

<pre><code>int year = 2000;</code></pre>

<p>to other numbers. Once your program is correct, save it as <code>LeapYear.java</code>.
You'll be submitting it below.</p>


<h2 id="c-using-git">C. Using Git</h2>


<p><strong>Note</strong>: In this class, you will not be submitting work via your instructional
accounts. You will instead be using a tool called Git to submit your work to a website called Github. Your instructional account will still be helpful if you want to work on the lab computers, but is not strictly necessary for the course.</p>

<p>If you'd like to learn more
about using your instructional account, please read <a href="../../../materials/guides/instructional-accounts.html">this guide</a>,
which can also be found on the <a href="../../../resources.html">resources page</a>
of the course website.</p>

<p>Git is a very useful tool, but a tricky one. We've written a guide that you'll be using through the semester. <strong>At the very least</strong>, you should now read through sections A, B, and C of our <a href="../../../materials/guides/using-git.html">Git guide</a>, and then work through the exercise in section D. Ideally, you should complete the remainder of the guide, including the exercise with a partner, but if time is short you can skip these sections for now. We expect you to eventually understand everything in this guide.</p>

<p>Git will quite possibly seem hard at first. <strong>It is a bad idea to jump in blindly and guess at git commands.</strong> You can find yourself in a bad spot. Read the Git guide, we mean it!</p>

<p>For
future reference, it is also linked in the <a href="../../../resources.html">resources page</a>.
After reading that guide, continue below because you'll be using Git to submit
your work for this lab.</p>


<h2 id="d-using-github">D. Using Github</h2>


<p class="redtext"><strong>STOP!</strong> Did your read the <a href="../../../materials/guides/using-git.html">Using Git Guide</a>?
If you didn't, don't go ahead. Read the guide first! You'll need it for the
steps that follow this point.</p>

<p>While it is technically possible to copy and paste most of what is going on below without understanding what is going, this will likely cause you considerable grief later on.</p>


<h4 id="setting-up-your-git-repository">Setting Up Your Git Repository</h4>


<p>Before beginning this section ensure that the name of your GitHub repository in the <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B">Berkeley-CS61B organization</a>
 matches your instructional account login. If this is not true, please let
your TA know.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: You'll need to perform this series of steps to set up your Git repo
on each computer you use (e.g. instructional computer, personal computer). If
you know that you'll only be using your personal computer, feel free to do this
just on your personal computer.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>Clone your <a href="https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B">Berkeley-CS61B organization</a>
  repository.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Navigate to the spot in your folders on your computer that you'd like to
    start your repository.</p>

<pre><code>$ cd cs61b</code></pre></li>
    <li><p>Enter the following command to clone your GitHub repo. Make sure to
    replace the <code>**</code> with your own instructional account login/repo name.</p>

<pre><code>$ git clone https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/**.git</code></pre>

    <p>If you'd like to SSH instead of HTTP (and <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys/">set up your own SSH key</a>),
    feel free to also do that instead.</p></li>
    <li><p>Move into your newly created repo! (Make sure you do this part, or the
    rest of the steps below will not work correctly.)</p>

<pre><code>$ cd **</code></pre></li>
  </ul></li>
  <li><p>Add the <code>skeleton</code> remote. You will pull from this remote repo to get starter code for assignments. (Make sure that you are within the newly created folder
  when the continue with these commands.)</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Enter the follow command to add the <code>skeleton</code> remote.</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote add skeleton https://github.com/Berkeley-CS61B/skeleton.git</code></pre></li>
    <li><p>Listing the remotes should now show both the <code>origin</code> and <code>skeleton</code>
    remotes.</p>

<pre><code>$ git remote -v</code></pre></li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>


<h4 id="working-on-the-skeleton">Working on the Skeleton</h4>


<ol>
  <li><p>You must now pull from the <code>skeleton</code> remote in order to get the starter code
  for lab1. You will also do this when new projects and assignments are released.</p>

<pre><code>$ git pull skeleton master</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>Move <code>LeapYear.java</code> into the <code>lab1</code> directory. You should be on your
  <code>master</code> branch. You can check this with the following command:</p>

<pre><code>$ git branch</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>Stage and commit <code>LeapYear.java</code>.</p>

<pre><code>$ git add lab1/LeapYear.java
$ git commit -m "Completed LeapYear.java"</code></pre></li>
  <li><p>Push these changes to the <code>master</code> branch on the <code>origin</code> remote repo.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin master</code></pre>

  <p>You can verify that this has been successful by checking your repo on
  GitHub.</p></li>
</ol>


<h4 id="complete-lab-1">Complete Lab 1</h4>


<p>Now that you have the skeleton, you should see a file in the lab1 directory
called <code>Year.java</code>.</p>

<p>You should fill it out, using your code in <code>LeapYear.java</code>. This time, however,
you'll notice that <code>year</code> is a parameter for the <code>isLeapYear</code> method rather than
a local variable within a method.</p>

<p>After you have filled out that file, commit your work as you did before.</p>

<a id="autograder"></a>#### Running the Autograder &amp; Submitting Homework

<ol>
  <li><p>At some points in your development, you may want to run the autograder.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Create an <code>ag/ASSIGNMENT</code> branch. In this case, the assignment is lab1.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b ag/lab1</code></pre></li>
    <li><p>If you've previously created this branch, you do not need the <code>-b</code> flag,
    which creates a new branch:</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout ag/lab1
$ git merge master</code></pre></li>
    <li><p>Push this local branch to your GitHub repo.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin ag/lab1</code></pre></li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

<p>After pushing to the autograder branch, you should receive an email to the
address associated with your login.</p>

<p class="redtext"><strong>Note 1</strong>: For just this first lab, you will not be
receiving an email. For other assignments, you will receive an email.</p>

<p><strong>Note 2</strong>: This autograder may not be running the full number of tests that will
be used to grade your assignment. (This especially true for the projects.) It
should be used as a sanity check, not as a thorough test.</p>

<ol>
  <li><p>If you are ready to submit your homework, you will push to a <code>submit</code> branch.</p>

  <ul>
    <li><p>Create a <code>submit/ASSIGNMENT</code> branch.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout -b submit/lab1</code></pre></li>
    <li><p>Similarly to with the autograder branch, if you have already created this
    branch, you just need to check it out and merge over your changes from your
    <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<pre><code>$ git checkout submit/lab1
$ git merge master</code></pre></li>
    <li><p>Push this local branch to your GitHub repo.</p>

<pre><code>$ git push origin submit/lab1</code></pre></li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>

<p>Note: You will not receive an autograder email from pushing to the <code>submit</code>
branch so do not worry about that. Also, you can continue pushing to the
<code>submit</code> branch if you find that you have corrections to make. We will run the
complete autograder for every assignment to get final grades only after the
deadline has passed.</p>
